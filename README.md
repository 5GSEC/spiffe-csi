# spiffe-csi
SPIFFE [Container Storage Interface](https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec/blob/master/spec.md) Driver for Kubernetes

The SPIFFE CSI Driver provides an ephemeral inline volume with a Workload API
socket provided by a SPIFFE Workload API implementation (e.g.  SPIRE Agent).

This work is still in a development phase.
